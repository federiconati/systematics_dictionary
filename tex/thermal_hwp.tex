\subsection{Thermal Variation in HWP Temperature}

\paragraph{Description:}
HWP thermal gradient and thermal fluctuations. A not uniform HWP temperature and its temporal fluctuations create a spatial and time dependent 2$f$ signal.

\paragraph{Plan to model and/or measure:}
Model: thermal finite element analysis of a HWP thermalized with a suitable heat sink and with a realistic time variable loading.
Measure: cryogenic measurements of the thermal gradients.


\paragraph{Uncertainty/Range:}
Realistic model of the time variation of the loading.


\paragraph{Parameterization:}
HWP thermal fluctuations: $\Delta_{HWP}(x,y,t)$ with $(x,y)$ the spatial coordinates of the HWP and $t$ the time.
