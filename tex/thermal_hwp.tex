\subsection{Thermal Variation in HWP Temperature}

\paragraph{Description:}
HWP thermal gradient and thermal fluctuations. A not uniform HWP temperature and its temporal fluctuations create a spatial and time dependent 0$f$, 1$f$, 2$f$, 4$f$ signals, etc. depending on the amplitude of harmonic decomposition of the temperature profile of the HWP. 

\paragraph{Plan to model and/or measure:}
Model: thermal finite element analysis of a HWP thermalized with a suitable heat sink and with a realistic time variable loading.
Measure: cryogenic measurements of the thermal gradients.


\paragraph{Uncertainty/Range:}
Realistic model of the time variation of the loading.

For a sapphire HWP, we expect this time variation effect to be small, as sapphire has a large thermal conductivity and large heat capacity, giving it both good thermalization properties and a large time constant.


\paragraph{Parameterization:}
HWP thermal fluctuations: $\Delta_{HWP}(x,y,t)$ with $(x,y)$ the spatial coordinates of the HWP and $t$ the time.

HWP thermal fluctuation time constant: 

\begin{equation}
\tau_{T_{HWP}} = C(T_{HWP})/G(T_{HWP}, T_{BCK})
\end{equation}

where $C$ is the HWP heat capacity as a function of its temperatue $T_{HWP}$, and $G$ is the thermal link between the HWP at $T_{HWP}$ and the surrounding environment at $T_{BCK}$. 

Then we expect the HWP temperature to fluctuate, assuming a fluctuating background at frequency $\omega_{BCK}$, as

 \begin{equation} 
 T_{HWP} \propto \frac{e^{i \omega_{BCK} t}}{i \omega_{BCK} + 1/\tau_{T_{HWP}}}
 \end{equation}
 
 Because the time constant is large, expect the thermal fluctuation to manifest at very low frequencies $\omega_{BCK}$.
