\subsection{Systematic/HWP}

\paragraph{Description:}
Differential transmission, reflection and emissivity creates a $2$f component in a polarimeter exploiting a rotating HWP
\cite{Salatino10}.

\paragraph{Plan to model and/or measure:}
Plan to model: HFSS model of the metamaterial HWP or data literature from Sapphire HWP.
Plan to measure:
differential transmission and reflection: FTS measurements;
differential emissivity: HWP emissivity measurements at different temperatures
(liquid nitrogen, room temperature and temperatures higher than room temperature).

\paragraph{Uncertainty/Range:}
Transmission and reflection measured at room temperature scaled to cryogenic temperatures, same for differential emissivity.

\paragraph{Parameterization:}
12 Mueller matrix top left components of a real HWP or eq.$\,$(7) and (8) in \cite{Salatino16}.



\paragraph{Description:}
HWP thermal gradient and thermal fluctuations. A not uniform HWP temperature and its temporal fluctuations create a spatial and time dependent 2$f$ signal.

\paragraph{Plan to model and/or measure:}
Model: thermal finite element analysis of a HWP thermalized with a suitable heat sink and with a realistic time variable loading.
Measure: cryogenic measurements of the thermal gradients.


\paragraph{Uncertainty/Range:}
Realistic model of the time variation of the loading.


\paragraph{Parameterization:}
HWP thermal fluctuations: $\Delta_{HWP}(x,y,t)$ with $(x,y)$ the spatial coordinates of the HWP and $t$ the time.
