\subsection{Differential Optical Properties of a HWP}

\paragraph{Description:}
Differential transmission, reflection and emissivity creates a $2$f component in a polarimeter exploiting a rotating HWP

\paragraph{Plan to model and/or measure:}
Plan to model: HFSS model of the metamaterial HWP or data literature from Sapphire HWP.
Plan to measure:
differential transmission and reflection: FTS measurements;
differential emissivity: HWP emissivity measurements at different temperatures
(liquid nitrogen, room temperature and temperatures higher than room temperature).

\paragraph{Uncertainty/Range:}
Transmission and reflection measured at room temperature scaled to cryogenic temperatures, same for differential emissivity.

\paragraph{Parameterization:}
12 Mueller matrix top left components of a real HWP or eq.$\,$(7) and (8) in %\cite{Salatino16}. add source to bibliography
