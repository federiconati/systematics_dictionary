\subsection{HWP Polarization angle}

\paragraph{Description:}
For a constant position of the HWP, the polarization angle of the HWP is the 
          direction along which an input polarized signal results in a maximum output from the 
          HWP.

\paragraph{Plan to model and/or measure:}
Plan to model: FTS measurements with a constant input polarized signal versus 
          the HWP at different incident angles.

Plan to measure:


\paragraph{Uncertainty/Range:} This depends on
          how well we know the detector angles,
          the input polarization angle, and the
          HWP angle

\paragraph{Parameterization:}
