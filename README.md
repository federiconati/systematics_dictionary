Systematics Dictionary

For each systematic, copy the tex/template file, enter the information, and place the file in the tex/ folder. Then input the systematic file into the master file. Make sure to add comments when you commit so that we can track changes. All sources should go in the syst.bib file.

Make sure that the dictionary still compiles after your changes.
